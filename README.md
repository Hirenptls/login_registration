This is a simple PHP-based login and registration system designed to help users register, log in, and access a dashboard using a MySQL database. This project is built using XAMPP (Apache, MySQL, PHP) and provides a basic example of how to handle user authentication.

Features
User registration with username, password, and email.
Password encryption using PHP's password_hash and password_verify functions.
User login with authentication.
A secure session-based dashboard for logged-in users.
User logout functionality.
Prerequisites
To run this project locally, you will need:

XAMPP: A local server environment for running PHP and MySQL. Download XAMPP.
Web Browser: To view and interact with the application.
Text Editor: For editing the PHP and HTML files (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
Setup Instructions
1. Install XAMPP
Download and install XAMPP from the link above.
Start the Apache and MySQL services from the XAMPP control panel.
2. Setup the Database
Open phpMyAdmin by navigating to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ in your browser.
Create a new database, for example user_db.
Create a table called users with the following fields:
sql
Copy
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
3. Set Up the Project
Download or clone this repository.
Move the project files to the htdocs directory inside your XAMPP installation folder (e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs\user_system).
Open your project directory in your browser:
arduino
Copy
http://localhost/user_system/
4. Access the Application
Registration Page: Navigate to http://localhost/user_system/register.php to register a new user.
Login Page: After registering, navigate to http://localhost/user_system/login.php to log in.
Dashboard: Upon successful login, you will be redirected to http://localhost/user_system/dashboard.php.
Logout: You can log out by clicking the "Logout" link on the dashboard page, which will take you to the login page again.

Security Considerations
Passwords are encrypted using PHP's password_hash function during registration and verified using password_verify during login.
Although this project provides basic functionality, it is important to ensure that your application is secured before deploying it to production. For example:
Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
Implement CSRF protection in your forms.
Consider using HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server.
Future Improvements
Validation: Add input validation for registration and login fields (e.g., check if the email is in a valid format).
Email Confirmation: Implement email confirmation for registration.
Password Reset: Add a password reset functionality using email.
Session Timeout: Add session expiration for security.
Admin Panel: Implement an admin panel to manage users.
